## Structure

There are several folders:
* .github -> CI configuration for Github Actions
* config -> configuration for environment for specific stage
* kubernetes -> kubernetes helm templates for staging and production environments
* plugin -> frontend (Remix plugin part that is used inside Remix)
* scripts -> folder with helpers scripts that are used with CI or are helpers for working with GKE
* server -> backend (Remix backend part with ink! cli that is run locally or on server)
* static -> Images for this README
* stress_test -> folder for running scripts that benchmark system

Bigger folders have their own READMEs with more detailed description.

Feel free to change the project and update the code and build it again, create a new project or anything else.

## Possible upgrades in the future

* Package whole project into tar/zip so it can be extracted and used elsewhere
* Integrating version control into the flow (git add, commit, push)
* Add dependency caching for faster build times
