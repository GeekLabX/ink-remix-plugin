# How to run

## Prerequisites

First run:
`bash
npm run install
`

To run tests on server run:
`bash
npm start`

## Structure of the folder

Src has a source for both testing create and build processes.
Currently only default examples are tested but we are adding more tests with different payloads and multithreading support so multiple create and build processes can be spawned in parallel.
